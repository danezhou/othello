Daniel - made the minmax tree, added alpha-beta pruning, messed around with heuristic for improvements in play

Andy - wrote the basic player code, wrote the heuristic along with many helper functions for calculating score



Group Improvements
-made a general weighted heuristic, added mobility factor
-added minmax tree
-tuned heuristic
-added alpha beta pruning, allowing program to search to depth 6 within time constraints
-updating cost table depending on board position
-tried searching to a larger depth, but number of calculations took too much time
